Syntax file for M$ SQL Server 2000 Transact-SQL

I added all reserved words, system functions and stored procedures.

Notes:
- All types, statements, and operators are colored as Keyword.
- All keywords must be UPPER_CASED.
- @local_variables (lower_cased) are colored as Special
- User-defined types in the form of "Some_User_Defined_Type" are colored as Type. (you must append the ending "_Type")
- @@SYSTEM_VARIABLES are colored as PreProc. Must be UPPER_CASED too.
